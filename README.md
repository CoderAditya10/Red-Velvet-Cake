# Red-Velvet-Cake
# Besides the basic flour, coca powder and sugar that you need, you also need sugar, lemon juice and white vinegar to make this easy eggless red velvet cake. I use vinegar and lemon juice because they are acidic in nature and react with the baking soda to make this cake truly soft and velvety. So please donâ€™t skip either of these ingredients. For the colour, I use edible artificial gel red color. You can use liquid color as well.
